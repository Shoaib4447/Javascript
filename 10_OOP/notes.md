# Javascript and classes

## OOP

## object

- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

# Why use OOP

## part of OOP

object literal

- constructor function
- prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

* Explain Inheritance in javascript : Inheritance is a way to reuse code in javascript. It is a way to create a new object that inherits properties and methods from another object. It is used to create a new object that has the same properties and methods as another object, but with some modifications.

* Explain Polymorphism in javascript : Polymorphism is a way to use the same method for different data types, such as strings, numbers, and objects.

## Javascript has prototypal behavior

* Explain Prototype in javascript : 
  It's like a blueprint for creating objects. It is a property of a function that is used to add properties and methods to the object. It is used to create a new object that inherits properties and methods from
  the prototype object.

  ## Prototype give us access of this and new keyword 

  * Explain this keyword in javascript :It is a keyword that is used to refer to the current object in a method. It is used to access the properties and methods of the current object.

  * Explain new keyword in javascript : It is a keyword that is used to create a new object. It is used to create a new instance of a class or object. It is used to call the constructor function and create a new object. It is used to create a new object that inherits properties and methods from the prototype object.

# Prototypal Inheritance
* Explain prototypal Inheritance in javascript : 
It is a type of inheritance in which objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object.



# Object in Prototypical behavior of Javascript
* Array -----> object -----> Null
* Object -----> object -----> Null
* Function -----> object -----> Null
* String is object
* Number is object
* Boolean is object
* Date is object
* RegExp is object
* Error is object
* Math is object
* JSON is object
* Symbol is object
* Map is object
* Set is object
* WeakMap is object
* WeakSet is object
* Promise is object
* Proxy is object
* Reflect is object
* Intl is object
* Intl.Collator is object
* Intl.DateTimeFormat is object
* Intl.NumberFormat is object
* Intl.PluralRules is object
* Intl.RelativeTimeFormat is object
* Intl.ListFormat is object
* Intl.Locale is object
